AKS Release Tracker

[![Update AKS Release files](https://github.com/zapstar/aks-release-tracker/actions/workflows/update-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zapstar/aks-release-tracker/actions/workflows/update-release.yml)

AKS doesn't publish when its releases have changed, so this repo will track all changes happening to `data.json` files on [AKS Release Status](https://releases.aks.azure.com/) page for us.
